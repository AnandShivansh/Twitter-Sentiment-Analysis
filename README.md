The sentiment analysis of any topic by parsing the tweets fetched from Twitter using Python.

The Jupyter notebook uses the saved logistic regression model which was trained using the data  [Sentiment140 dataset with 1.6 million tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140). It also uses the saved word2vec model trained on the same data.
